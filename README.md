Coding-Everyday

In parallel to daily sketching/painting, I want to code daily.
No more excuses for not being a good programmer, I've gotta work hard!

So I'll lay out some ground-rules:

1. Commit one new piece of code daily! Don't get caught up in sizes and make
     sure it works!
2. Each new day gets its own folder
3. Place a ReadMe in each folder to explain the project and declare any packages
     used.
4. Have fun! Find new ways to apply common algorithms.
5. If you can't get it to work that day, outline what you want it to do and fix
     it when the inspiration or desire to do so hits.
    - Then upload what you have
    - Write a notice in the ReadMe that the code is incomplete/not working
    - Update ReadMe when complete
6. Post a screen-shot of the working program in the front of the folder with the
     ReadMe
7. If you miss a day, at least get some sleep. Sleep is healthy
8. Document and comment well!

Exceptions:

a. Go ahead and spend a second day or two on something bigger, just be sure to
     relabel the folder as both days


I'm likely going to be doing much of the dailies in Python, Ruby, or Java. Maybe
I'll branch out after I get into it. Feel free to use the code if it strikes you
as useful, maybe link me to what you do with it so I can see what neat project
you made!

If you wish to follow me elsewhere, perhaps see a few of my terrible daily
artworks that I'm working on also or keep up with the daily code, you can find
most of my stuff at my site S-Vortex.com (or will once I get things set up,
shouldn't be too long)

Go ahead and fork to your hearts content, maybe I'll organize folders by
usernames if you wished to join in!
